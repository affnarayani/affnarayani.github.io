**Effective Date: April 21, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how WA Quick Connect ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our mobile application.

## 1. Information We Collect

WA Quick Connect is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information necessary to provide our services:

- Phone numbers you enter (temporarily stored only on your device)
- Country codes you select (temporarily stored only on your device)
- Basic device information for app functionality and crash reporting

We do not store your contacts, messages, or any communication content on our servers.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used solely to:

- Provide the core functionality of connecting you to WhatsApp without saving contacts
- Remember your recently used numbers for convenience (stored only on your device)
- Improve the app through anonymous usage statistics and crash reports
- Comply with legal obligations when required

## 3. Data Storage and Security

All phone numbers and country codes you enter are stored locally on your device only. This data is not transmitted to our servers or shared with third parties except when you choose to open WhatsApp with a specific number.

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

## 4. Third-Party Services

Our app integrates with WhatsApp through their official API. When you use our app to open WhatsApp, you are subject to WhatsApp's own terms of service and privacy policy.

We may use third-party services for:

- Analytics to improve app performance and user experience
- Crash reporting to identify and fix technical issues
- Advertising to support the free version of the app

These services may collect basic device information and usage statistics but do not have access to the phone numbers you enter or your WhatsApp messages.

### 4.1 Advertising

Our app displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. These ads may use cookies and device identifiers to personalize content and measure ad performance. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visit to our app and other sites on the Internet.

You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Google's Ad Settings or by using your device's opt-out settings where available.

## 5. Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Clear your recently used numbers from the app at any time
- Request information about what data we collect
- Opt out of analytics and crash reporting (through your device settings)

## 6. Children's Privacy

Our app is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
